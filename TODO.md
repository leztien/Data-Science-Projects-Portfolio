# Portfolio Projects:

Project 1: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) - This shows that you can clearly tell a story with your data. It also shows that you can collect, clean, and perform feature engineering. I recommend scraping your data or collecting it from an open api.

Project 2: Classification problem - With these projects you are predicting a binary or categorical outcome. An example would be the titanic dataset where you predict if people would have survived the crash. [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/)

Project 3: A regression problem - In these types of analyses, you try to predict a continuous outcome. An example would be predicting how many likes a youtube video would get ;).

Project 4: A clustering problem - With this we use algorithms to understand which data points are related to eachother. 

Project 5: An advanced topic (NLP, Computer Vision, Deep Neural Nets) - These projects allow you to specialize and show off your skills!
