At the moemnt I'm transferring my portfolio projects into this folder, so it is mostly empty.
For now here are the links to my older mini projects:

- [KNN Regression](https://github.com/leztien/portfolio-project-knn-regression)
- [Fuzzy Magic (web app for fuzzy matching)](http://www.fuzzymagic.eu/) and [repo with the code](https://github.com/leztien/FuzzyMagic)
- [github repos](https://github.com/leztien)
