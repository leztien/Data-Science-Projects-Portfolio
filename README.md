my portfolio of data science projects for a potential employer

At the moemnt I'm transferring my portfolio projects into this folder, so it is mostly empty.
For now here are the links to my older mini projects:

- [KNN Regression](https://github.com/leztien/portfolio-project-knn-regression)
- [FuzzyMagic (web app for fuzzy matching)](http://www.fuzzymagic.eu/) and the [web app code](https://github.com/leztien/FuzzyMagic)
- [Python package to identify similar entries in spreadsheets](https://github.com/leztien/FuzzyMagic/tree/main/fuzzyspreadsheets)
- [dashboard app (made with plotly-dash)](https://github.com/leztien/plotly-dashboard)
- [my selected github repos for demonstration purposes](https://github.com/leztien)
